# Chromatofore Filament Exchanger - 3D Printable Components

**Description:** 

Chromatofore is a pioneering automatic filament exchanger tailored for entry-level Bowden 3D printers such as the Creality Ender 3 v2 and CR-6 SE. The repository hosts OpenSCAD files that define all parts of the system that need to be 3D printed.

This repository complements the OctoPrint plugin for Chromatofore, allowing users to produce the physical components necessary to benefit from the automatic filament exchanging capabilities the software provides.

## Components Overview

This repository comprises a range of 3D printable components tailored for the Chromatofore Filament Exchanger. The files are structured for ease of printing and assembly, ensuring that even 3D printing novices can assemble their own filament exchanger.

## 3D Printing Guidelines

- **Material Recommendations:** PLA or PETG for optimal strength and durability.
- **Infill:** 20% - 30% recommended for structural parts.
- **Layer Height:** 0.2mm - 0.3mm for best results.
- **Supports:** Check individual part requirements. Some parts may require supports.

## Assembly

1. **Preparation:** Ensure all printed parts are cleaned of any supports or brims.
2. **Components:** Gather all necessary non-printed components (screws, bolts, electronics) as referenced in the assembly guide.
3. **Follow the Assembly Guide:** A step-by-step guide (linked here) will walk you through the assembly process.
